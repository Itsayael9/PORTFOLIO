        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>ðŸ’» Aspiring Full-Stack Developer | Passionate About Problem-Solving & Backend Development

            I am a dedicated and motivated developer with a strong passion for coding and problem-solving. My journey into programming began when I joined CMC University to specialize in Digital Development, and since then, I have been committed to expanding my expertise in both frontend and backend technologies.
            
            I have experience working with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Python, and OOP, and I have built projects such as a portfolio website and a to-do list app using Flask. Currently, I am deepening my knowledge in JavaScript, C (through Harvardâ€™s CS50 course), and databases, with the goal of mastering PHP to strengthen my backend development skills.
            
            ðŸ”¹ What sets me apart? My strong passion for learning, my dedication to building real-world projects, and my commitment to becoming a skilled backend or full-stack developer. I thrive on solving complex challenges and continuously improving my coding abilities.
            
            I am eager to connect with professionals in the tech industry, collaborate on exciting projects, and take on new challenges that push my skills to the next level. Let's connect!</p>
